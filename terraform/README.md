# Infrastructure Deployment Recommendations

## Executive Summary

This infrastructure plan was generated by Inframate based on analyzing your application's requirements and codebase structure.

### Recommended AWS Services:

AWS S3, AWS CloudFront, AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, AWS DynamoDB (if serverless and simple data), AWS RDS (if relational data needed), AWS ECS/Fargate, AWS EC2 Auto Scaling Group, AWS VPC, AWS Route 53, AWS Certificate Manager, AWS CloudWatch, AWS IAM, AWS WAF

## Detailed Recommendations

*   **Static Content Hosting:** Host the React application's static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) on AWS S3. Configure AWS CloudFront as a CDN in front of S3 for caching and improved performance, especially for global users. This utilizes S3's low-cost storage and CloudFront's global edge network.
*   **Serverless API (Recommended):** Implement the application's backend API using AWS Lambda and API Gateway. This offers excellent scalability, cost efficiency (pay-per-use), and simplified management. Consider DynamoDB for the database if the data model is suitable for a NoSQL database and you want to stay serverless.
*   **Containerized Deployment (Alternative):** Package the application into a Docker container and deploy it using AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) with Fargate launch type. Fargate eliminates the need to manage EC2 instances and offers pay-per-use pricing.  This is a good option if you need more control over the runtime environment or have complex dependencies. An EC2-backed ECS cluster with autoscaling would also work but is more complex to manage.
*   **Relational Database (If Needed):** If the application requires a relational database, use AWS RDS (Relational Database Service) with a suitable engine like PostgreSQL or MySQL. Consider Aurora for improved performance and scalability.
*   **Networking:** Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to isolate your resources. Use public and private subnets to control access. Use a NAT Gateway or NAT Instance for outbound internet access from private subnets.
*   **Domain & SSL/TLS:** Use AWS Route 53 for DNS management and AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for provisioning SSL/TLS certificates.
*   **Monitoring & Logging:** Utilize AWS CloudWatch for monitoring application performance, infrastructure health, and logging.  Implement detailed metrics and alerts. Send logs to CloudWatch Logs.
*   **Security:** Implement strong IAM roles and policies to control access to AWS resources. Use AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) to protect the application against common web exploits. Enable encryption at rest and in transit. Regularly review and update security configurations.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform):** Use Terraform to manage and provision all AWS resources. This ensures consistency, repeatability, and version control of the infrastructure.
*   **Auto-Scaling:** Configure auto-scaling based on CPU utilization, memory usage, or other relevant metrics for the Lambda functions (if serverless) or ECS Fargate tasks/EC2 instances.
*   **Database Choice:** Choose between DynamoDB and RDS (PostgreSQL/MySQL) based on data model requirements. DynamoDB is better for simpler, non-relational data. RDS provides relational database capabilities. If using RDS, enable backups and set up replication for high availability.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:**  Although not included in the directory structure, a robust CI/CD pipeline is crucial for continuous integration and deployment. Use AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, or GitHub Actions.
*   **State Management:** Store your Terraform state remotely using AWS S3 and DynamoDB for locking. This enables collaboration and prevents state corruption.

## Estimated Monthly Costs

This is a rough estimate and can vary greatly depending on usage, region, and specific configurations. Prices are based on the `us-east-1` region as of Oct 26, 2023.
*   **S3 (Static Hosting):** \$1 - \$5 (depending on storage and transfer)
*   **CloudFront (CDN):** \$5 - \$20 (depending on data transfer and requests)
*   **Lambda (API):** \$5 - \$20 (depending on invocations and compute time)
*   **API Gateway:** \$1 - \$5 (depending on requests)
*   **DynamoDB (if used):** \$5 - \$20 (depending on storage and throughput)
*   **RDS (if used, t3.micro):** \$15 - \$25 (depending on instance size and storage)
*   **ECS Fargate (if used, small task):** \$20 - \$50 (depending on vCPU and memory)
*   **Route 53:** \$0.50 (Hosted Zone) + query fees (negligible for a small app)
*   **CloudWatch Logs:** \$1 - \$5 (depending on log volume)
*   **WAF (if used):** \$5 - \$15 (depending on rules and requests)
**Total Estimated Monthly Cost:** \$58.5 - \$185 (highly variable based on selected architecture and usage)

*Note: These cost estimates are approximate and may vary based on usage patterns, region, and AWS pricing changes.*

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
   - Terraform installed (v1.0.0+)

2. **Configuration**:
   - Update variables in `terraform.tfvars` to match your requirements
   - Review the Terraform files to ensure they meet your needs

3. **Deployment**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

4. **Cleanup**:
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

## Notes

- The Terraform files have been generated in the `terraform/` directory
- The configuration is based on the application requirements specified in `inframate.md`
- You may need to customize the Terraform files for your specific needs
